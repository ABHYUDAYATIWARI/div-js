If you're using Windows, then you should also be prepared for:

- Random updates at the worst possible time.

- Your PC restarting just as you were about to save your work.

- Clicking "Remind me later" on updates like it's a full-time job.

- Watching Task Manager struggle to close Task Manager.

- Explaining to your grandparents why their PC is "slow" because they installed every free toolbar.

- Keep a backup of your backup because you never know when Windows will decide to self-destruct.

- Accept that "Not Responding" is just a normal phase in your workflow.

- Appreciate the art of watching a spinning blue circle for minutes, hoping it leads to something productive.

- Understand that the true meaning of patience is waiting for "Getting Windows ready. Don't turn off your computer."

- Know that Windows Defender will proudly tell you it "found no threats" while your PC is running slower than a snail in quicksand.

- Realize that clicking "Skip" during an update just makes Windows angrier for next time.

- Enjoy the thrill of Windows randomly deciding that today is the day your Wi-Fi adapter forgets it exists.

Basically, 
- using Windows is like living with an overly dramatic roommate who insists on rearranging your furniture while you're still sitting on the couch. 
- using Windows is like dating someone who randomly disappears for "updates" but comes back slower and with more issues. ðŸ˜†
